            <h1>Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)</h1>
            <p>
            Our IOP enables patients to continue their day-to-day regimen while simultaneously undergoing our best possible care. Measured on a case-by-case basis, patients may live in our treatment center, in a sober living community, or at their own home.<br /> <br />At Fremont Rehab Clinic, we recognize that overcoming addiction on your own may not be possible. Fortunately our treatment programs give you the path to healing/recovery. Through our intensive outpatient program, we give you the tools to manage your addiction in the most healthy way possible. To learn more, reach out to us today.</p>

            <h1>Why choose an IOP?</h1>
            <p>
            It is common for those struggling with addiction to not respond well to residential treatment options. An intensive outpatient program may be the best alternative, as it can offer a high level of care and more accountability (removing patients from access to drugs/alcohol, enabling peers, etc.).

            <br /><br />
            If the patient has a strong, supportive family and group of friends/peers, they will be able to undergo care with us, but also be able to live at home.
